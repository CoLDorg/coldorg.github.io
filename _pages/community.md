Join our community to 🤝 meet other members of **Co.L.D.**, get to work on new 🔧🚧 projects, and 🎤 talk to our [Core Committee](#). You can also keep up with us on our social media channels.

# Community Channels
## Discord
**Co.L.D.** uses Discord as its primary community workspace.
In fact, Discord is used for the regular discussions related to 🐱‍💻 competitve coding contests. So there might be some ⚖️ rules below specific to that context only 🤷‍.

The invite link to join the Discord server are made live during the membership drive (they happen in August) of the club. If you were unable to join during that time, write a mail to us (with enough details so that we can ascertain that you are a JNUSE student) and we'll send you the invite.

By joining our Discord community you must agree to follow a few simple rules.

### ⚖️ The Rules
-----------------------
**Only send messages in ENGLISH.**

1. Be 🤵 civil and respectful.
2. Listen to the Moderators (always!).
3. 🔞 NSFW content is not allowed (ever).
4. 🚯 Spamming anywhere can get you banned.
5. 🚯 No advertisement of other Discord Servers (any).
6. 🙄 Cheating in a contest aka asking for solutions for some contest which is still running will get you banned (immediately).
7. Harassment will get you in 👮 trouble (see [Code of Conduct](/community/#code-of-conduct)).
8. When 🙋‍♂️ asking for help please use `#general-help` and provide all information related to the problem. For e.g., for a coding problem this information will include:
    - Problem Statement
    - Your Code
    - What should be happening
    - What's actually happening
    - Any kind of effort you made to actually solving the problem yourself.

9. 🤖 Bots can be used in all channels but that doesn't mean you're allowed to spam the commands where you shouldn't.

10. Do not 🙅‍♂️ send messages to random people asking for help. We have a channel `#general-help` where you can leave your questions and wait for someone to answer you. However, if both parties are okay with taking their conversation private then it is okay. Note that if several people reported that you are being disturbing you might be 🦶 kicked off the server.

11. For all competitive coding contests, the 👨‍🏫 discussions will be held one day after any contest is over.

12. Do not forget to visit the roles section and assign yourself the languages 💻 (coding obviously) you are fluent with.

Finally, don't troll, discriminate, bully or do anything illegal. See [Code of Conduct](/community/#code-of-conduct) for more details.

## Slack
**Co.L.D.** has a Slack community with sub-communities for various projects and fields. It is open to the students of School of Engineering, JNU and you can ✒️ [sign up here](https://coldorg.slack.com/). If you're not familiar with Slack, please read ["Getting Started" on Slack's usage guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/360000049043). Information on joining a specific channel is on ["Join a channel"](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel). Once you join, please introduce yourself on `#members` channel.

### Some Tips
---
- You will automatically join the `#general` and `#announcements` channels when you sign in to the Slack for the first time.
- `#general` is for general purpose discussions relevant to **Co.L.D.**
`#announcements` is for 📢 announcements from the Core Committee.
- If you're looking to 💬 talk to someone on the Core Committee, you're most likely to find us on Slack between 11:00AM and 8:00PM IST on weekdays.

## GitHub

# Code of Conduct
*This Code of Conduct applies to all digital spaces managed by our team, including GitHub, Discord, and any other spaces which the development community uses for communication.*

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the **Co.L.D.** team at [coldexecs@gmail.com](mailto:coldexecs@gmail.com) (one may also contact using other mediums if the matter demands urgency). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
