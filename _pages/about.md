**Co.L.D.** is the Computer Science Club of [School of Engineering](https://jnu.ac.in/se), [JNU](https://jnu.ac.in). We help the students of SE to come together and become a part of the institute's coding community. With a diverse Core Committee running the club, we combine individual expertise and insight to help our members grow their professional skills while also serving as a link to the professional industry by making available to our members a plethora of oppurtunites.
